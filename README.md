Bear in mind this course is just a memento, the work was not supposed to be finished and polished product, rather a showcase of different aspects of software engineering. 

Some things were pushed back to backlog to never be moved to "DONE" intentionally, to showcase the priority selection process. 
The multi-step file commenting the development process was not submitted in this repo, as I'm afraid of bots and other students reusing my work too efficiently :)
